Interactive SVG Drawing Tool with Mouse Event Handlers

Test Cases & Validations
EVENT: mousedown

Requirement: Must start a new drawing path when the user presses the mouse button inside the SVG area.

Expected Behavior:

A new <path> element is created dynamically in SVG.

The starting point of the path is set at the exact mouse position.

Test Cases:

Valid: Clicking inside the canvas starts a new line.

Invalid: Clicking outside the SVG should not create any path.

EVENT: mousemove

Requirement: Should continuously draw/extend the line as the mouse moves while the button is held down.

Expected Behavior:

Each new mouse position is connected to the previous one with a line segment (L command in SVG path).

Test Cases:

Valid: Dragging the mouse draws smooth lines.

Invalid: Moving the mouse without pressing the button should not draw anything.

EVENT: mouseup

Requirement: Must stop the current drawing when the user releases the mouse button.

Expected Behavior:

Line stops extending further.

User can start a new line by pressing again.

Test Cases:

Valid: Releasing the mouse stops the drawing.

Valid: Clicking again starts a fresh path.

MULTIPLE DRAWINGS

Requirement: User must be able to draw multiple shapes/lines without refreshing the page.

Expected Behavior:

Each click-and-drag creates a separate <path>.

Test Cases:

Valid: First drag creates "Byte", second drag can create "XL".

Invalid: If paths overwrite each other (only one path exists), then code is incorrect.
