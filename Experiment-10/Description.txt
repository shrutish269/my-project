EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM – TEST CASES & VALIDATIONS
1. FUNCTIONALITY: Add Employee
Requirement:

Both Name and ID fields are required.

Employee ID must be unique (no duplicates allowed).

VALID INPUTS:

Name: "Alice" , ID: "E104"

Name: "Bob" , ID: "E105"

INVALID INPUTS:

Name empty → should trigger Name and ID are required.

ID empty → should trigger Name and ID are required.

Duplicate ID → e.g., trying to add ID "E101" again triggers An employee with ID E101 already exists.

2. FUNCTIONALITY: List Employees
Requirement:

Lists all employees in the system with their Name and ID.

If no employees exist, display "No employees found."

VALID INPUTS:

After adding employees, selecting list shows all current employees.

INVALID INPUTS:

Not applicable (listing always works; empty list handled).

3. FUNCTIONALITY: Remove Employee
Requirement:

Employee ID is required to remove an employee.

If the ID does not exist, display "Employee with ID <ID> not found."

VALID INPUTS:

ID exists → employee is removed and message "Employee <name> (ID: <ID>) removed successfully." displayed.

INVALID INPUTS:

ID does not exist → triggers "Employee with ID <ID> not found."

Empty ID input → triggers "Employee with ID <ID> not found."

4. APPLICATION FLOW
Menu repeatedly displays until user selects Exit.

Options:

Add Employee

List Employees

Remove Employee

Exit

Behavior:

Input outside 1–4 → triggers "Invalid choice. Please enter 1-4."

Exit → prints "Goodbye!" and stops program.

5. VALIDATION SUMMARY
Feature	Validation
Name & ID required	Cannot be empty; must provide values
ID uniqueness	No duplicate IDs allowed
Menu input	Only numbers 1–4 allowed; other inputs trigger invalid choice message
Remove Employee	ID must exist; otherwise error message displayed
